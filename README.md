# Simple KNN Algorithm

The main aim is to understand how K Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm actually works. In simple terms, KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm which helps to classify new input cases based on similarity to other cases. In this context, the cases that are near each other are said to be neighbours(distance is calculated between them).
KNN predicts to which class the new input case belongs to when k nearest neighbours are chosen.
